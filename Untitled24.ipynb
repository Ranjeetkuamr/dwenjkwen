    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to do multiple things at the same time. This can be especially helpful for programs that perform a lot of I/O operations, as these operations can often be done in parallel.\n",
    "Improved responsiveness: Multithreading can also improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to continue running even when one of its threads is blocked. This can be helpful for programs that interact with the user, as it ensures that the user interface remains responsive even when the program is performing a long-running task.\n",
    "Simplified code: Multithreading can also simplify the code of a program by allowing it to be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading can introduce complexity into a program, as it requires the programmer to be aware of the potential for race conditions and other concurrency issues.\n",
    "Reduced performance: In some cases, multithreading can actually reduce the performance of a program. This can happen if the program is not properly designed for multithreading, or if the operating system does not have good support for multithreading.\n",
    "Increased resource usage: Multithreading can increase the resource usage of a program, as each thread requires its own memory and processing time."

For example, imagine two threads, A and B, that are both trying to access a shared resource, such as a file. Thread A has the file open and is reading from it. Thread B also wants to read from the file, but it cannot because Thread A has it open. Thread B will then wait for Thread A to release the file. However, Thread A cannot release the file because it is waiting for Thread B to finish reading from it. This situation is called a deadlock.\n",
